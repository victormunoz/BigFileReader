# Big File Reader

Very big text files usually cannot be read with common text readers, like notepad, notepad++.
Those programs display messages like "File is too big to be opened".
Even some specialized software for big files (like LTFViewr5u) may also hang when trying to read huge files (e.g. more than 1Gb).
However sometimes you just need to read some specific, or random, lines in the file.
This program allows to do this with arbitrarily big text files.
